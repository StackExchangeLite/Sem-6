\defn{Topology}{A \emph{topology} $\tau$ on a set $X$ is a collection $\mathscr{B}$ of sets called \emph{open sets} such that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\varnothing$ and $X$ belong to $\mathscr{B}$
\item For any collection of sets $U_{\alpha} \in \mathscr{B}$, $\cup_{\alpha} U_{\alpha}$ is also in $\mathscr{B}$ (closed under arbitrary unions)
\item For any finite collection $\{U_1,U_2 \cdots U_k\}$ of sets of $\mathscr{B}$, $\cap_{i=1}^{k}U_i \in \mathscr{B}$ (closed under finite intersections)
\end{enumerate}}
\defn{Discrete and Indiscrete topology}{\begin{enumerate}
    \item The topology $(\varnothing,X)$ of a set $X$ is called the \emph{indiscrete topology}.
    \item The topology in which every subset of $X$ is an open set is called the \emph{Discrete topology}
\end{enumerate} }
\defn{Finer and Coarser topologies}{Let $\tau$ and $\tau'$ be two topologies of space $X$. We say $\tau'$ is \emph{finer} than $\tau$ if $\tau \subset \tau'$, or every open set in $\tau$ is one in $\tau'$. In other words, $\tau$ is \emph{coarser} than $\tau$.}
\begin{remark}
    Of course, not all topologies are comparable, like the above definition suggests. For example, consider the 3 element space $\{x,y,z\}$. $\{\varnothing,(x),(x,y),(x,y,z)\}$ is a topology as can easily be seen. Likewise, $\{\varnothing,(x),(y,z),(x,y,z)\}$ is also a topology, but these two are not comparable, since their symmetric difference is non-empty.
\end{remark}
\begin{example}
    \textbf{The finite complement topology:} Let $X$ be a set. Consider the set of all $U \in X$ such that $U^C$ is either finite or $X$. Obviously, $\varnothing$ is in this collection, as is $X$. Let $\{U_{\alpha}:\alpha \in A\}$ by an arbitrary collection of such sets. Consider $(\cup_{\alpha} U_{\alpha})^C=\cap_{\alpha} U^{C}_{\alpha}$ which is easily seen to be finite. Hence, closed under arbitrary unions.
    Consider $\{U_1,U_2 \cdots U_k\}$ of such sets. $(\cap_{i=1}^{k}U_{i})^C=\cup_{i=1}^{n} U^{C}_i$ which is, at max, finite. Hence, closed under finite intersections. Therefore, this collection is a topology and is called the \emph{Finite Complement Topology}.
\end{example}

\defn{Basis for a topology}{Let $X$ be a space. $C$ is called a \emph{basis} for $X$ if the following are satisfied:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item For every $x \in X$, there exists a $C_x$ in $C$ so that $x \in C_x$
    \item If $x$, $C_1$ and $C_2$ are such that $x \in C_1 \cap C_2 \neq \varnothing$, then there exists $C_{12} \in C$ such that $x \in C_{12} \subseteq C_{1} \cap C_{2}$ 
\end{enumerate}}

\defn{Topology \emph{generated} by a basis $\C$ of $X$}{The topology $\tau_{\C}$ generated by the basis $\C$ is defined as the collection $\U$ of subsets of $X$ such that if $U \in \U$, and $x \in U$, then there exists $C \in \C$ such that $x \in C \subseteq U$. It is obvious that $\C$ itself is contained in $\U$. }
\thmp{The topology $\tau_{\C}$ generated by $\C$, a basis, does indeed form a topology.}{Does $X$ belong to $\tau_{\C}$? let $x \in X$. By virtue of being a basis, there exists a $C_x \subseteq X$ such that $x \in C_x$. Hence, $X \in \tau_{\C}$. Does $\varnothing \in \tau_{\C}$? Vacuously so. Let $U_{\alpha}$ be open in $\tau_{\C}$. Consider $\cup_{\alpha} U_{\alpha}$ and $x \in \cup_{\alpha} U_{\alpha}$. This means $x \in U_{\delta}$ for some $\delta$. That means that there exists $C_{x}$ so that $x \in C_x \subseteq U_{\delta} \subseteq \cup_{\alpha} U_{\alpha}$. This means $\tau_{\C}$ is closed under arbitrary union.
Consider singleton collections, for the moment, of the kind $\{U_1\}$. It is obvious that the intersection of every element in this collection is part of $\tau_{\C}$. Consider a two sized collection $\{U_1,U_2\}$. Let $x \in U_1 \cap U_2$. Obviously, $x \in C_1 \subseteq U_1$ and $x \in C_2 \subseteq U_2$. From the definition of basis, there exists a basis element $C$ so that $x \in C \subseteq C_1 \cap C_2 \subseteq U_1 \cap U_2$ making $\cap_{i=1}^2 U_i$ part of the topology. Assume such is true for all $n$ sized collections. Consider an $n+1$ sized collection $\{U_1,U_2 \cdots U_{n+1}\}$ and consider $x \in (\cap_{i=1}^{n} U_{i} ) \cap U_{n+1}$. From the $n=2$ case and induction hypothesis, we are done. Hence, closed under finite intersections. $\tau_{\C}$ is indeed a topology.   }
\thmp{Let $\C$ be a basis for $X$. The topology generated by $\C$, that is, $\tau_{\C}$ is precisely the topology obtained by taking all possible, arbitrary union's of $\C$.}{Consider an arbitrary union of elements $C_{\alpha} \in \C$, $\cup_{\alpha} C_{\alpha}$. $x \in \cup C \implies \exists \alpha$ such that $x \in C_{\alpha}$. Therefore, $\cup_{\alpha}C_{\alpha}$ is in $\tau_{\C}$. Now, let $U \in \tau_{\C}$. For every $x \in U$, there exists $C_x$ in $\C$ such that $x \in C_x \subseteq U $ (Definition of the generated topology). That means, $U=\cup_{x: x \in U} C_x$ which makes it the union of sets in the collection $\C$. We are done.}
\begin{example}
    If $X$ is a metric space, the collection $\{B_{\varepsilon}(x): x \in X, \varepsilon \in \RR^+\}$ is a basis for $X$. 
\end{example}

\begin{remark}
Note that, every topology $\tau$ is its own basis. It must also be noted that the same topology can be generated by two different bases. Consider for example the set of all open subsets of $\RR$. Also consider the set of all open balls in $\RR$. Or, consider the set of all $\frac{1}{n}$ balls around all rational points of $\RR$
\end{remark}
\thmp{(Going from a topology to a basis) Suppose $(X, \tau)$ is a topological space, and $\C$ is a collection of sets in $X$ (which is a subset of $\tau$) such that for every $x \in X$ and for every $U \in \tau$ such that $x \in U$, $\exists C_x \in \C$ such that $x \in C_x \subseteq U$. Then $\tau$ is actually generated by $\C$}{Let $x \in X$. That means, $\exists C_x \in \C$ (from hypothesis) such that $x \in C_x \subseteq X$. Moreover, let $x \in C_1$ and $C_2$. By hypothesis, all $C \in \C$ are conidered open sets, therefore, $C_1 \cap C_2$ is an open set, and $x \in C_1 \cap C_2$. That means $\exists C_3 \in \C$ such that $x \in C_3 \subseteq C_1 \cap C_2$. That makes $\C$ a basis. Its now obvious that $\tau=\tau_{\C}$ }
\thmp{(Criteria for derermining coarseness from basis) Let $\tau$ and $\tau'$ be two topologies of $X$. Also suppose $\tau$ is generated by $\C$ and $\tau'$, by $\C'$. Then the following are equivalent: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\tau'$ is finer than $\tau$
    \item for each $x \in X$ and each basis element $C \in \C$ containing $x$, there exists $C' \in \C'$ such that $x \in C' \subseteq C$

\end{enumerate} }{$\implies)$ Suppose $\tau'$ is finer than $\tau$, that means every open set open in $\tau$ is also open in $\tau'$. Let $C \in \C$, which is open in $\tau$ (and hence, in $\tau'$ too) and let $x \in C$. Since $C$ is open in $\tau'$, and $x \in C$, there exists a basis element of $\tau'$, called $C'$ such that $x \in C' \subset C$. 
\\\\ $\impliedby)$ Let it be that for every $x \in X$ and for every $C \in \C$ such that $x \in C$, there exists $C' \in \C'$ such that $x \in C' \subseteq C$. By the definition of topology generated by bases, it is clear that $\C$ is part of the topology of $\tau'$. Consider $U \in \tau$. 
\\\\ $U$ is an arbitrary union of elements of $\C$ (by the alternate characterisation of generated topology), making $U$ an element of $\tau'$. We are done.
\\\\ (aliter) Let $U$ be such that for every $x \in U$, $\exists C \in C$ such that $x \in C \subseteq U$. Since we are told that there exists $C' \subseteq C$ so that $x \in C'$, we have that for all $x \in U$, $\exists C'_x \in \C' $ so that $x \in C_x' \subseteq U$, making $U$ part of the topology of $\tau'$. }
\defn{Standard topology of $\RR$}{Let $\B$ be the collection of all open intervals of the kind $(a,b):a,b \in \RR$. That this is a basis is obvious. Define the standard topology as that topology generated by this basis.}
\defn{lower limit topology $\RR_l$}{Conider $\B'$ the collection of all sets of the kind $[a,b): a,b \in \RR$. Again, that this is a basis is obvious. Define the lower limit topology as the topology generated by $B'$, and denote it as $\RR_l$}
\defn{K topology $\RR_K$}{Let $K$ be the set of all numbers of the kind $1/n$ for $n \in \ZZ_+$. Denote $\B''$ as the collection of all open intervals of the kind $(a,b)$ along with the sets of the form $(a,b)-K$. Again, that this is a basis is obvious. The topology generated by $\BB''$ is called the $K$ topology, denoted by $\RR_K$}
\thmp{$\RR_K$ and $\RR_l$ are strictly finer than $\RR$, but $\RR_K$ and $\RR_l$ are not comparable.}{Consider $B \in \B$, of the form $(a,b)$. This is also in $\B'$, and a smaller set of the kind $[c,d)$ lies inside $(a,b)$, which means that, if $x \in (a,b)$, there exists $B' \in \B'$ and $B'' \in \B''$ so that $x \in B' \subset (a,b)$ and $x \in \B'' \subset (a,b)$. Moreover, since both $\RR_l$ and $\RR_K$ have elements that are not in $\RR$, it is obviously strictly finer. (Consider $a \in [a,b)$, there is no element of the kind $(x,y)$ that is inside this, that contains $a$. )
\\\\ Consider an element $B=[0,1)$ where we choose $x=0$. Clear that no element from $\RR_K$ can come inside $B$ whilst containing $0$. On the other hand, consider $0$ inside $(-1,1)-K$ in $\RR_K$. No interval of the kind $[a,b)$ can contain $0$ and itself be contained inside $(-1,1)-K$. Hence, it is clear that $\RR_K$ and $\RR_l$ are incomparable.  }

(and by definition, since $\B$ is asked to be a subset of $\TTT_X$, we see that every $B \in \B$ is also open.

\defn{Subbasis}{A subbasis $S$ is a collection of subsets of $X$ whose union amounts to $X$}
\defn{Topology generated by a subbasis}{$\tau_S$, the topology generated by the subbasis $S$ is defined as the set of all arbitrary unions of the set of all finite intersection of elements of $S$. }
\thmp{$\tau_S$, the topology generated by a subbasis $S$, is indeed a topology.}{Let $S$ be the set whose union forms $X$ (Subbasis). 

Let $Y=\{\gamma: \gamma=\cap_{i=1}^n S_i \text{ for some }n \text{ and }S_i \in S\}$, i.e, $Y$ is the set of all finite intersections of elements of $S$. Consider the set of all arbitrary union of elements of Y, and call it $\tau_S$. Obviously $\tau_S$ cotains $\varnothing$ and $X$. Let $\{U_{\alpha}\}$ be a collection of open sets in $\tau_S$, i.e, each $U_{\alpha}$ is an arbitrary union of elements that are finite intersection of elements of $S$. The union of all $U_{\alpha}$, therefore, would still be an arbitrary union of finite intersections of elements of $S$, hence, is back in $\tau_S$. Now consider $\{U_1,U_2 \cdots U_k\}$, elements of $\tau_S$ such that each $U_i$ is an arbitrary union of a collection of sets that are each a finite intersection of elements of $S$. Consider the finite intersection $\cap_{i=1}^{n} U_i=\cap_{i=1}^n (\cup_{\alpha} (\cap_{j=1}^{n_{\alpha}}S_{j,\alpha}) )$ which is ultimately an arbitrary union of a finite intersection of sets in $S$, making this part of $\tau_S$. Hence, $\tau_S$ is indeed a topology.} 
\thmp{Let $\{\tau_{\alpha}: \alpha \in A\}$ be a collection of topologies of $X$, then there is a unique "smallest" topology $\tau_S$ such that $\tau_S$ contains all the topologies $\{\tau_{\alpha}\}$ (kinda like a LUB), and there is a unique "largest: topology $\tau_L$ that is contained in all these topologies $\{\tau_{\alpha}\}$.}{\underline{\textbf{$\tau_S$ that contains all topologies $\{\tau_{\alpha}\}$}}:
\\\\ \emph{Uniqueness:} If two such topologies exists, we can take the intersection of them to result in a smaller topology (intersection is still a topology) that contains $\{\tau_{\alpha}\}$.
\\\\ \emph{Existence:} Consider the topology generated by arbitrarily unioning the sets generated by finitely intersecting all elements of $\{\tau_{\alpha}: \alpha \in A\}$. Explicitly, we collect $\R=\{U: \exists x \text{ such that }U \in \tau_{x}\}$ and we take all possible finite intersections of elements in $\R$ and collect that in a set $\S$. Then, we take all possible arbitrary unions of elements of $\S$ and call it $\tau_S$. 

For later use: 

$\bullet$ $\R=$ all the open sets in all the topologies. 

$\bullet$ $\S=$ finite intersection of all elements of $\R$

$\bullet$ $\tau_S=$ arbitrary union of all elements of $\S$

Is $\tau_S$ a topology? $X$ and $\varnothing$ are obviously there, since $X$ and $\varnothing$ are there in $\R$, and we take the singleton intersection of these in $\S$, and finally, we take the singleton union of these to arrive at $X, \varnothing \in \tau_S$. Let $\{G_{\delta}:\delta \in \Delta\}$ be a collection of sets in $\tau_S$ (i.e, a collection of sets that are an arbitrary union of a collection of finite intersection of elements of $\R$). $\cup_{\delta}G_{\delta}$ would also be an arbitrary union of elements of $\S$ making it part of $\tau_S$. Let $\{G_1,G_2,\cdots G_k\}$ be in $\tau_S$. $\cap_{i=1}^k G_i=\cap_{i=1}^k (\cup_{\delta_i} (\cap_{j=1}^{n_{\delta_i}} R_{\delta_i,j} ) )$ which, from De Morgan's Laws, can easily be seen to be an arbitrary union of a finite intersection of elements from $\R$.

            $\TTT(\Sigma)$ is the smallest topology that contains $\Sigma$.

\subsection{Order Topology}
\defn{Simple Order}{Let $X$ be a set. Define $C:X \times X \to \{y,n\}$ such that: \begin{enumerate}
    \item If $x \neq y$, either $xCy$ or $yCx$
    \item For no $x$ is it true that $xCx$
    \item if $xCy$ and $yCz$, then $xCz$
\end{enumerate} This type of relation is called \emph{simple order} relation.
\\\\ \textbf{Pro Tip:} For intuition purposes, replace $C$ with $<$. }

\defn{Order Topology on a space $X$.}{Let $X$ be a space with more than two points, equipped with a simple order relation $<$. Consider the collection $\B$ of sets of the following kind:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $(a,b)$ where $a<b$. i.e, all open intervals in $X$
    \item $[a_0,b)$ for all $b \in X$, where $a_0$ is the smallest element of $X$
    \item $(a,b_0]$ for all $a \in X$ where $b_0$ is the largest element in $X$
\end{enumerate} Then the order topology $\tau_O$ is defined as that topology generated by $\B$.
\begin{remark}
    Note that, if $X$ has no smallest element, type (2) sets won't exist in $\B$. Likewise, if $X$ has no largest element, type (3) sets won't exist in $\B$.

\end{remark}}
\thmp{$\B$ is actually a basis (hence, $\tau_O$ is actually a well defined topology on $X$)}{Let $x \in X$. If $x$ is not the largest element, nor the smallest, then there exists $(a_0,b_0)$ that contains $x$
\\\\ If $x$ is the largest element, then $(a_0,x]$ contains $x$. If $x$ is the smallest element, then $[x,b_0)$ contains $x$. Hence, for every $x \in X$, there exists an element $B$ from $\B$ such that $x \in B$. 
\\\\ Note the following, if we intersect two type 1 sets, we get back a smaller type 1 set. i.e, $(a,b) \cap (a',b'):= \{x\in X: a<x<b \text{ and } a'<x<b' \}$.
\\ If we intersect two type 2 sets, we get back a type 2 set (obviously)
\\ If we intersect two type 3 sets, we get back a type 3 set (obviously)
\\ If we intersect a type 1 and type 2 set, i.e $(a,b)$ and $[a_0,x)$, we are basically saying $\{t \in X: a < t < b \text{ and }a_0 \leq t<x \}$ We get back a type 1 set.
\\ If we intersect a type 1 and type 3 set, i.e $(a,b)$ and $(x,b_0]$, we get $\{t \in X: a<t<b \text{ and } x<t \leq b_0 \}$ which would yield a set of type 1.
\\ If we intersect a type 2 and type 3 set, i.e, $[a_0,x)$ and $(y,b_0]$, we want basically $\{t \in X: a_0 \leq t <x \text{ and } y<t \leq b_0\}$. It is easy to see that this intersection falls into one of the 3 categories. 
\\\\ Hence, $\B$ forms a basis, and hence, $\tau_B$ is a topology.
}
\begin{example}
    The standard topology $\RR$ is basically the order topology on $\RR$. All one needs to see is that there is no least element, and largest element of $\RR$ (Of course, $\RR \cup \{-\infty,+\infty\}$, the extended real line, \emph{does} have these). Hence, $\B$ is just all elements of the kind $(a,b)$, which is precisely the basis for the standard topology.  
\end{example}
\defn{Rays}{Given $a \in X$ (a simply ordered set), there are 4 sets associated with $a$ called \emph{rays}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $(a,+\infty):=\{x: a<x\}$
    \item $(-\infty,a):=\{x: x<a\}$
    \item $[a,+\infty):=\{x:a \geq x\}$
    \item $(-\infty,a]:=\{x: x \leq x\}$

\end{enumerate}}
\thmp{The first two rays are open in the order topology, (and the 2nd two rays are closed in the order topology, i.e, its complement is open)}{Consider $(a,+\infty)$. If there is no maximum element, then this is precisely an arbitrary union of sets of the kind $(a,b_{\alpha})$. If there is a maximal element, then this is $(a,b_0]$. In a similar fashion, the 2nd set is also open.
\\\\ Consider $[a,+\infty)^C=(-\infty,a)$, and consider $(-\infty,a]^C=(a,\infty)$. Obvious from here.}
\thmp{The collection of all open \emph{rays} forms a subbasis for the order topology on $X$}{We have to show that the topology generated by arbitrarily unioning a collection of finite intersections of rays gives rise to the topology generated by the bais of order topology of $X$. Let $\tau_R$ be the topology generated by the arbitrary union of finite intersection of rays. Let $\tau$ be the order topology on $X$, generated by arbitrary union of the basis elements of $X$. We want to show $\tau_R \subseteq \tau$ and $\tau \subseteq \tau_R$.
\\\\ Consider $(a,b)$, a basis element of $\tau$. $(a,+\infty) \cap (-\infty,b)$ is a finite intersection of rays, and yields the basis $(a,b)$. $[a_0,b)$ is, simply, $(-\infty,b)$ and $(a,b_0]$ is simply $(a,+\infty)$. Hence, finite intersection of the rays yield the basis elements. Arbitrary union of finite intersection of rays can yield all the possible open sets of the order topology on $X$. Hence, $\tau \subseteq \tau_R$. Let $S$ be open in $\tau_R$. It is the arbitrary union of a finite intersection of rays. Note that every ray is either an element of the basis for $\tau$ or is an arbitrary union elements of basis of $\tau$. An arbitrary union of a finite intersection of an arbitrary union of elements of the basis yields an arbitrary union of a finite intersection of elements of the basis, giving rise to yet another element of the topology $\tau$. Hence, every open et in $\tau_R$ is open in $\tau$, hence $\tau_R \subseteq \tau$ }
\subsection{The product topology}
\defn{Product topology on $X \times Y$}{Let $\tau_X$ and $\tau_Y$ be topologies of $X$ and $Y$ respectively. Let $\B$ be the collection of subsets of $X \times Y $ of the kind $U \times V$ for $U \in \tau_X$ and $V \in \tau_Y$. We define the product topology as that which is generated by the basis $\B$. }
\thmp{$\B$ of the previous definition is indeed a basis.}{Let $(x,y) \in X \times Y $. Since $X \in \tau_X$ and $Y \in \tau_Y$, we have that $(x,y)\in X \times Y$ so the 1st condition for basis is satisfied. Let $(x,y) \in U_1 \times V_1$ and $U_2 \times V_2$. Consider $(U_1 \times V_1)\cap (U_2 \times V_2)$. This is same as $U_1 \cap U_2 \times V_1 \cap V_2$ which is again an element of $\B$. Hence, it is a basis and hence $\tau_{\B}$ is well defined.}

(given by$\langle \{U \times V: U \text{ open in} \TTT_X \text{ and } V \text{ open in } \TTT_Y \} \rangle$) has a basis $\B:=\{C \times D: C \in \B_X, D \in \B_Y\}$, i.e, $$\TTT_{X \times Y}=\langle \{U \times V: U \in \TTT_X, V \in \TTT_Y\} \rangle=\langle_{\text{basis}} \B:=\{C \times D: C \in \B_X, D \in \B_Y\} \rangle$$}{\emph{Checking that $\B$ is indeed a basis:}
\\\\ Let $(x,y) \in X \times Y$. $x \in X$ means that there exists $B \in \B_X$ so that $x \in B \subseteq X$. Likewise, for $y$, there is a $C \in \B_Y$ so that $y \in C \subseteq Y$, which means $(x,y) \in B \times C \subseteq X \times Y$. This means that $\B$ obeys the 1st condition for a basis.
\\\\ Let $(x,y) \in B,B' \in \B$. i.e, $(x,y) \in C_1 \times D_1, \text{ and }C_2 \times D_2 $ for $C_1,C_2 \in \B_X$ and $D_1,D_2 \in \B_Y$. That means that $(x,y) \in (C_1 \times D_1) \cap (C_2 \times D_2)=(C_1 \times C_2) \times (D_1 \times D_2)$. $x \in C_1 \cap C_2$ means there is a $C_3$ so that $x \in C_3 \subseteq C_1 \cap C_2$. Likewise, $y \in D_3 \subseteq D_1 \cap D_2 $. Hence, $(x,y) \in (C_3 \times D_3) \subseteq (C_1 \cap C_2) \times (D_1 \times D_2)=(C_1 \times D_1)\cap (C_2 \times D_2)$. Hence, $\B$ is a basis.
\\\\ Now consider any open set in $\TTT_{X \times Y}.$ Since $\TTT_{X\times Y}$ is generated by $U \times V: U \in \TTT_X, V \in \TTT_Y$, Every open set in $\TTT_{X \times Y}$ is an arbitrary union of sets of the kind $U \times V$, i.e, $\cup_{\alpha}(U_{\alpha}\times V_{\alpha})$. But each $U_{\alpha}= \cup_{\delta(\alpha)} B_{\delta}^{\alpha}$ for $B_{\delta}^{\alpha} \in \B_X$. Likewise, each $V_{\alpha}= \cup_{\delta(\alpha)} C_{\delta}^{\alpha} $ for  $C_{\delta}^{\alpha} \in \B_Y$. Let $(x,y)$ be any point in $X$, that is in $\cup_{\alpha}(U_{\alpha} \times V_{\alpha})$ which means that there exists $\alpha_0$ so that $(x,y) \in U_{\alpha_0} \times V_{\alpha_0}= \cup_{\delta(\alpha_0)} B_{\delta} \times \cup_{\delta{(\alpha_0)}} C_{\delta}$. This means $x \in B_{\delta_0}$ and $y \in C_{\delta_1}$ for some indices. This means that $(x,y) \in B_{\delta_0} \times C_{\delta_1}$, which is part of the basis $\B$. Hence, Every open set in $\TTT_{X\times Y}$ is open in $\langle \B \rangle$ (or $\TTT_{X \times Y} \subseteq \langle \B \rangle$). Moreover, it is obvious to see that every element of $\B$ is open in $\TTT_{X \times Y}$. Hence, arbitrary union of elements of $\B$, which are precisely the open sets of $\B$, are also open in $\TTT_{X \times Y}$. Hence, $\TTT_{X \times Y}=\langle \B \rangle$.

\begin{example}
    Consider $X=\RR, Y=\RR$, with the standard topologies (i.e, that which is generated by the basis elements of the kind $\{(a,b); a<b\}$). The \textbf{\emph{standard topology}} on $\RR \times \RR=\RR^2$ is defined as the product topology. A basis for this topology is the set of all $U \times V$ for $U$ and $V$ open in $\RR$, but from the preceeding result we can find an even smaller subset that makes a basis: $\{B \times C: B \in \B_X, C \in \B_Y\} $ which is precisely $\{(a,b) \times (c,d): a,b,c,d \in \RR; a<b, c<d\}$

\defn{Projections}{Define $\pi_1:X \times Y \to X$ by $\pi_1(x,y)=x$ and $\pi_2:X\times Y \to Y$ given by $\pi_2(x,y)=y$. These maps are called projection maps.}
\thmp{The projection maps are onto, and have the property that, if $U$ is an open subset of $X$, and $V$ is an open subset of $Y$, then $\pi_1^{-1}(U)=U \times Y $ and $\pi_2^{-1}(V)=X \times V$ (well, open hypothesis is not needed really)}{That they are onto functions is obvious. Let $U$ be an open subset of $X$. Consider $\pi_1^{-1}(U):=\{(x,y) \in X \times Y: \pi_1(x,y)=x \in U\}$. This is precisely $U \times Y$. Similarly, $\pi_2^{-1}(V)=X \times V$. Note that, in the product topology, $U \times Y$ and $X \times V$ are both open sets. Moreover, the intersection of $\pi_1^{-1}(U)$ and $\pi_2^{-1}(V)$ is $(U \times Y) \cap (X \times V)= U \times V$ }
\thmp{Let $\TTT_X$ be a topology for $X$ and $\TTT_Y$ for $Y$. Let $\TTT_{X \times Y}:=\langle \{U \times V: U \in \TTT_X, V \in \TTT_Y\} \rangle $ be the product topology on $X \times Y$. Then the set $\Gamma:=\{\pi_1^{-1}(U):U \in \TTT_X\} \cup \{\pi_2^{-1}(V): V \in \TTT_Y\}$ forms a subbasis for $\TTT_{X\times Y}$}{$\Gamma$ is full of elements of the kind $U \times Y$ and $X\times V$ (every element is of this kind, and every element of this kind is in $\Gamma$). Consider any open set in $\TTT_{X \times Y}$, which is an arbitrary union of elements of the type $U \times V$, or explicitly, an open set looks like $\cup_{\alpha}(U_{\alpha} \times V_{\alpha})$ which is the same as $\cup_{\alpha}((U_{\alpha} \times Y)\cap (X \times V_{\alpha}))=\cup_{\alpha} \pi_{1}^{-1}(U_{\alpha}) \cap \pi_2^{-1}(V_{\alpha})$ which is an arbitrary union of an intersection of elements of $\Gamma$. Hence, we see that every set open in $\TTT_{X \times Y}$ is open in $\langle_{subbasis} \Gamma\rangle$, which means $\TTT_{X \times Y} \subseteq \langle_{subbasis }\Gamma \rangle$. Let $C$ be a set in $\langle_{subbasis} \Gamma \rangle$, i.e, $C$ is an arbitrary union of a finite intersection of sets in $\Gamma$. If the finite intersection only contains elements of the kind $U \times Y$ (or $X \times V$), then the intersection would ultimately be of the kind $U_0 \times Y$ for some $U_0$ open in $\TTT_X$ (or $X \times V_0$ for some $V_0$ open in $\TTT_Y$), which would then mean $\cup_{0} U_0 \times V$ would finally still yield a set of the form $U \times V$, falling again into $\TTT_{X \times Y}$ (or the other thing). 
\\\\ If suppose the finite intersection contains both elements of the type $U \times Y$ and $X \times V$, then intersecting them yields $U \times V$, and suppose some other set is of the kind $U' \times Y$ (or $X \times V'$), an intersection with them still yields a set of the type $U'' \times V''$ for some open $U'' \in \TTT_X$ and $V'' \in \TTT_Y$. This again shows that, arbitrarily unioning them will still make it fall into $\TTT_{X \times Y}$, which finally gives us $\langle_{subbasis} \Gamma \rangle=\TTT_{X \times Y}$ }
\subsection{Subspace Topology}
\defn{Subspace Topology}{Let $X$ be a topological space with a topology $\TTT_X$ and let $Y \subset X$. We define the \emph{\textbf{subspace topology}} on $Y$ as $\TTT_Y:=\{U \cap Y: U \in \TTT_X\}$}
\thmp{The Subspace topology is indeed a topology on $Y$}{$\varnothing=Y \cap \varnothing$ and $Y=Y \cap X$. Hence $\varnothing$ and $X$ are both in $\TTT_Y$. Let $U_{\alpha}$ be a collection of sets in $\TTT_Y$, i.e $U_{\alpha}=G_{\alpha} \cap Y$ for $G_{\alpha} \in \TTT_X$. $\cup_{\alpha} U_{\alpha}=\cup_{\alpha} (G_{\alpha} \cap Y)=(\cup_{\alpha} G_{\alpha}) \cap Y \in \TTT_Y$. Closed under arbitrary union.
\\\\ Let $U_1,U_2 \cdots U_k$ be a bunch of sets of the kind $G_i \cap Y$. Arbitrary intersection of these yields $\cap_{i=1}^k U_i= \cap_{i=1}^{k} (G_i \cap Y)= (\cap_{i=1}^{k} G_i) \cap Y$ which is again of the form $K \cap Y$ for some $K \in \TTT_X$, which makes this finite intersection a part of $\TTT_{Y}$. Hence, $\TTT_Y$ is a topology.   }
\lemp{Let $\B_X$ be a basis for $\TTT_X$ on $X$. Then the basis of $\TTT_Y$, the subspace topology of $Y \subseteq X$ is $\C:=\{B \cap Y: B \in \B_X\}$}{Let $y \in Y$, this means $y \in X$, which means $y \in B \in \B_X$. That means $y\in B \cap Y \in \C$. Let $y \in C_1$ and $C_2$, which are in $\C$. That means $y \in (B_1 \cap Y) \cap (B_2 \cap Y)=(B_1 \cap B_2) \cap Y$ which means $y \in (B_3) \cap Y$ so that $B_3 \subseteq B_1 \cap B_2$, implying that $B_3 \cap Y \subseteq B_1 \cap Y \cap B_2 \cap Y$, giving us that if $y \in C_1$ and $C_2$ in $\C$, there exists $C_3 (=B_3 \cap Y)$ so that $y \in C_3 \subseteq C_1 \cap C_2$, hence $\C$ forms a basis for $\TTT_Y$. Now we need to show that $\TTT_{Y}:=\{U \cap Y: U \in \TTT_X\}$ is the same as $\TTT_{\C}:=\langle \C \rangle$. Let $R$ be open in $\TTT_{Y}$ implying it is of the form $U \cap Y$ for some $U \in \TTT_X$. But $U= \cup_{\alpha} B_{\alpha}$ for basis elements $B_{\alpha} \in \B$. That gives $R=U \cap Y=(\cup_{\alpha} B_{\alpha} )\cap Y=\cup_{\alpha} (B_{\alpha}\cap Y) $ which is an arbitrary union of elements of $\C$. Hence, $\langle \C\rangle \subseteq \TTT_Y$.
\\\\ Let $G$ be in $\langle \C \rangle$, i.e, is an arbitrary union of $C_{\alpha}=B_{\alpha} \cap Y \in \C$. Hence, $G=\cup_{\alpha}(B_{\alpha} \cap Y)= (\cup_{\alpha} B_{\alpha})\cap Y $ making it part of $\TTT_Y$ (its of the form "some open set" intersected with $Y$). This means $\TTT_Y \subseteq \langle \C \rangle$ which ultimately gives $\langle \C \rangle = \TTT_Y$ }
\lemp{Let $Y \subseteq X$ and let $\TTT_Y$ be the subspace topology on $Y$ inherited from the topology $\TTT_X$ on $X$. Then, $Y$ is open in $X$ (i.e, is in $\TTT_X)$ if and only every set open in $Y$, i,e, is in $\TTT_Y$ is open in $X$.}{$\implies$) Let $Y$ be open in $X$, that means $Y \in \TTT_X$. $\TTT_Y:=\{U \cap Y: U \in \TTT_X \}$. Let $G=U \cap Y$ be an open set in $\TTT_Y$, for some open set $U$ open in $X$. Since $\TTT_X$ is closed under finite intersections, $G=U \cap Y$ is open in $\TTT_X$. Hence every set in $\TTT_Y$ is in $\TTT_X$.
\\\\ $\impliedby$) If every set in $\TTT_Y$ is in $\TTT_X$, that means that $Y$ is also in $\TTT_X$, making $Y$ open in $X$.}
\thmp{Let $X$ be a space with a topology $\TTT_X$ and $Y$ with $\TTT_Y$. Consider $A \subseteq X$ and $B \subseteq Y$. $A \times B \subseteq X \times Y$. We have that $$\TTT^{S}_{A\times B}=\TTT^{P}_{A \times B}$$ where $\TTT^{S}_{A \times B}$ represents the subspace topology of $A \times B$ viewed as a subspace of the product topology $X \times Y$, and $\TTT^{P}_{A \times B}$ represents the product topology of $A \times B$, whose individual topologies come from the corresponding subspace topologies.}{Let $F$ be an open set in $\TTT^{S}_{A \times B}$, i.e, it is of the form $G \cap (A \times B)$ for some $G \in \TTT_{X \times Y}$, i.e, $G$ is an arbitrary union $\cup_{\alpha} (U_{\alpha} \times V_{\alpha})$ ($U_{\alpha} \in \TTT_X$ and $V_{\alpha} \in \TTT_Y$). Therefore, $F=[\cup_{\alpha}(U_{\alpha}\times V_{\alpha})]\cap(A \times B)= \cup_{\alpha} ((U_{\alpha} \times V_{\alpha}) \cap (A \times B))=\cup_{\alpha} ((U_{\alpha} \cap A) \times (V_{\alpha} \cap B))$. Note that $U_{\alpha} \cap A$ and $V_{\alpha} \cap B$ are each open in $A$ and $B$ respectively (from the subspace topology inherited from $\TTT_X$ and $\TTT_Y$ respectively). Therefore, $U_{\alpha} \cap A \times V_{\alpha} \cap B$ is part of the basis for the product topology $A \times B$ (since its a product of open sets in $A$ and $B$). Hence, $F$ is an arbitrary union of elements of $\{U \times V: U \in \TTT_A, V \in \TTT_B\}$ which means that it is in $\TTT^{P}_{A \times B}$. This implies $\TTT^{S}_{A \times B} \subseteq \TTT^{P}_{A \times B}$.
\\\\ Let $F'$ be an open set in $\TTT^{P}_{A \times B}$, i.e, is an arbitrary union of elements of the kind $U_r \times V_r$ where $U_r \in \TTT_A$ and $V_r \in \TTT_B$. $F'= \cup_{r} (U_r \times V_r)=\cup_{r}(G_r \cup A) \times (E_r \cup B)$ for $G_r \in \TTT_X$ and $E_r \in \TTT_Y$. This is $F'=\cup_{r} (G_r \times E_r) \cup (A \times B)= \cup_{r} (\text{basis element of }\TTT_{X \times Y}) \cap (A \times B)= \cup_{r} (\text{some basis element of }A\times B)_{r} $ which is obviously open in $\TTT^{S}_{A \times B}$. Hence, $\TTT^P_{A \times B} \subseteq \TTT^S_{A \times B }$}
Though the subspace topology inherited by $A \times B \subseteq X \times Y$ is precisely the product topology of the corresponding subspace topologies, a similar result, though reasonable to expect for subspaces of order topologies, does not, unfortunately, hold; as the following example reveals:
\begin{example} (\textbf{Order topology inherited from superspace is \emph{not} equal to the subspace topology inherited from ordered superspace})
    Consider $Y=[0,1] \cup \{2\} \subseteq \RR$. The topology on $\RR$ is generated by the basis $(a,b):a,b \in \RR$. The subspace topology on $Y$ is generated by the sets $(a,b) \cap Y: a,b \in \RR$. Call this $\TTT^S_Y=\langle \{(a,b)\cap Y: a<b\}\rangle$.  The order topology on $Y$ is generated by sets of the kind $(x,y): x,y \in Y$, $[0,y): y \in Y$, along with $(x,2: x \in Y]$. Note that $\{2\}$ is open in the subspace topology since $\{2\}=(1.5,2.5) \cap Y$. But $\{2\}$ cannot be open in the order topology inherited by $Y$ since any basis element containing $2$ contains some other element of $Y$ as well. \end{example}

    \begin{example}
        Let $I=[0,1]$. Consider $I \times I$ as a subset of $\RR\times \RR$, which has topology $\TTT^O_{\RR \times \RR}$ obtained by the simple lexicographic order. The basis elements of $\TTT^0_{\RR \times \RR}$ is given by $\{(a\cdot b, c \cdot d): a<c \text{ or } (a=c \text{ and }b<d )\}$ (Since there is no smallest or largest element of $\RR \times \RR$ in the lexicographic order). The basis for $\TTT^S_{I \times I}$ is $(a\cdot b, c\cdot d: a,b,c,d \in \RR ) \cap (I \times I)$. Meanwhile, the basis for $\TTT^0_{I \times I}$ are sets of the form $\{(p\cdot q, r\cdot s):p,q,r,s \in I\}$, $[0\cdot 0, x \cdot y)$, $(x\cdot y, 1\cdot 1]$. Consider the interval $(0.5\cdot-5,0.5\cdot5)$ which is open in $\RR \times \RR$. Take the subspace element $I \times I \cap (0.5 \cdot -5, 0.5\cdot 5)$. This would be $[0.5 \cdot 0, 0.5 \cdot 1]$. This is open in the subspace topology, but this is not open in the order topology since no basis element of $\TTT^0_{I \times I}$ contains $0.5 \cdot 0$ which is also in itself contained in the above interval.
\end{example}
Taking motivation from the previous example, we define the following:
\defn{Ordered Square}{The set $I \times I \subseteq \RR \times \RR$, where $I=[0,1]$ with the lexicographic order topology is called the \emph{ordered square} and is denoted by $I^2_0$ }

\lemp{Let $\B$ be a subbasis for the topology $\TTT$ on $X$. Then the subspace topology $\TTT_S$ of $S \subseteq X$ is generated by the subbasis $\{G \cap S: G \in \B\}$}{Let $U$ be an open set in $\TTT_S$. Then it is of the form $K \cap S$ for some open set $K$ in $\TTT$, making it an arbitrary union $\cup_{\alpha} (\cap_{i=1}^{k_{\alpha}}(E_{\alpha,i}))$ of elements $E_{\alpha,i}$ of $\B$. This gives $U=( \cup_{\alpha} (\cap_{i=1}^{k_{\alpha}}(E_{\alpha,i})) )\cap S= \cup_{\alpha} ((\cap_{i=1}^{k_{\alpha}}(E_{\alpha,i}))\cap S)=\cup_{\alpha} (\cap_{i=1}^{k_{\alpha}}(E_{\alpha,i}\cap S))$ which is an arbitrary union of a finite intersection of elements from $\{G \cap S: G \in \B\}$. Hence, $\langle_{subbasis}\{G \cap S: G \in \B\} \rangle \subseteq \TTT_S$. Any element of $\langle_{subbasis}\{G \cap S: G \in \B\} \rangle$ is of the form $K=\cup_{\alpha} (\cap_{i=1}^{k_{\alpha}}(F_{\alpha,i}))$ for $F_{\alpha,i}=G_{\alpha,i} \cap S$ for $G_{\alpha,i}$ that are in $\B$. Then we can rewrite $K$ as $\cup_{\alpha} (\cap_{i=1}^{k_{\alpha}}(G_{\alpha,i} \cap S))=\cup_{\alpha} ([\cap_{i=1}^{k_{\alpha}}(G_{\alpha,i}))]\cap S$ which is of the form $\gamma \cap S$ where $\gamma$ is an arbitrary union of a finite intersection of elements of $\B$, making $\gamma$ open in $\TTT$ and ultimately $K$ open in $\TTT_S$. Hence, $\langle_{subbasis}\{G \cap S: G \in \B\} \rangle \subseteq \TTT_S$ giving us $\langle_{subbasis}\{G \cap S: G \in \B\} \rangle=\TTT_S$.  }

\defn{Convex Sets}{Given an ordered set $X$, a subset $Y$ is called \emph{\textbf{convex}} if for any two points $a,b$ in $Y$, if $a<b$, then $(a,b)$ is fully contained in $Y$. Intervals and rays are always convex.}
\thmp{Let $X$ be an ordered set in the order topology $\TTT^0_X$. Let $Y$ be a subset of $X$ that is convex, i.e, for any two points $a,b$ in $Y$ so that $a<b$, we have $(a,b) \subseteq Y$. Then the order topology on $Y$, $\TTT^0_Y$ is the same as the subspace topology $\TTT^S_Y$ inherited from the order topology $\TTT^0_X$.}{$$\TTT^0_Y:= \langle \{(x,y)_{Y}: x,y \in Y\}, \{[y_L,q)_Y:q \in Y\}, \{(q,y_U]_Y: q \in Y\} \rangle$$
$$\TTT^S_Y:=\langle \{(a,b)_X \cap Y: a,b \in X\}, \{[a_0,b)_X \cap Y: b \in X\}, \{(a,b_0]\cap Y: a \in X\} \rangle $$ 
First we prove that $\TTT^0_Y \subseteq \TTT^S_Y$. Consider the basis elements of the kind $(x,y)_Y: x,y \in Y$ and let $z \in (x,y)_Y$. $(x,y)_Y:=\{z \in Y: x<z<y\}=\{z \in X: x<z<y \text{ and }z\in Y\}=(x,y)_X \cap Y$ which is a basis element of $\TTT^S_Y$. 
\\\\ Now consider basis elements of the kind $[y_L,y)_Y=\{z \in Y: y_L \leq z <y\}=\{z \in X: y_L\leq z<y \text{ and } z \in Y\}=[y_L,y)_X \cap Y$. if $q \in [y_L, y)_Y$ and $q \neq y_L$, then we can look at $(y_L,y)_X \cap Y$ which contains $q$ and is readily inside $[y_L,y)_Y$. If $q=y_L$, Consider a smaller element that $y_L$, say $L \in X$, and consider $(L,y)_X \cap Y=(L,y)_Y=[y_L,y)_Y$, which implies that $q=y_L \in (L,y)_X \cap Y \subseteq [y_L,y)_Y$ (If $y_L$ is the least in $X$, too, then take the 2nd type basis element of $\TTT^S_X$). 
\\\\ Consider the bases elements of the kind $(y,y_U]_Y=(y,y_U]_X \cap Y$. Let $q$ be in this set, and not equal to $y_U$. Then take $(y,y_U)_X \cap Y$ which is a subset of the above basis element. If $q=y_U$, then in $X$ take a larger element $U$ and consider $(y,U)_X \cap Y=(y,y_U]_Y$ which contains $q$ and is itelf contained in $(y,y_U]_Y$. Moreover, if the largest element of $X$ and $Y$ conincide, then take the 3rd type from $\TTT^S_Y$. 
\\\\ Therefore, $\TTT^0_Y \subseteq \TTT^S_Y$.
\\\\ Now we prove that $\TTT^S_Y \subseteq \TTT^0_Y$. If our basis element is of the kind $(a,b)_X \cap Y$, and $p \in (a,b)_X \cap Y$, we have a few cases to consider. \begin{enumerate}
\item $a< y$ for every $y \in Y$, and $b>y$ for every $y \in Y$. \begin{enumerate}\item Suppose no $z$ is in $Y$ so that $a<z<q$, and likewise, no $z'$ is so that $q<z'<b$. That makes $q$ the least, and the largest element of $Y$. The order topology on $Y$ then would be trivial. \item Suppose such $z$ exists so that $a<z<q$, but no such $z'$ exists so that $q<z'<b$. That means $q$ is the largest element, and we can pick the basis $(z,q]_Y$ that contains $q$ and is inside $(a,b)_X \cap Y$. \item Suppose no such $z$ exists but such $z' $ exists, then we see $q$ is the least element, and thus we can look at $[q,z')_Y$ that contains $q$. \item If suppose both $z$ and $z'$ exist, then we can simply choose $(z,z')_Y$ containing $q$.  \end{enumerate}
\item Suppose $z \in Y$ is so that $z<a$ but $b>y$ for every $y$. \begin{enumerate}
    \item Suppose no $z'$ exists in $Y$ so that $q<z'<b$. Then $q$ would be the largest element of $Y$, and due to convexity of $Y$, $a \in Y$. This would give us the basis element $(a,q]_Y$ that contains $q$ and is fully contained in $(a,b)\cap Y$
    \item If there exists $z'$ in $Y$ so that $q<z'<b$, simply choose the basis element $(a,z')_Y$ that contains $q$ and is contained in $(a,b)_X \cap Y$
\end{enumerate}
\item Suppose $z' \in Y$ is so that $b<z'$ but for every $y \in Y$, $a<y$. \begin{enumerate}
    \item Suppose no $z''\in Y$ exists so that $a<z''<q$, that means that $q$ is the minimal element of $Y$, and that, from convexity, $b$ is in $Y$. This means we can pick the basis element $[q,b)_Y$ that contains $q$ and is contained in $(a,b)_X\cap Y$
    \item Suppose there exists $z'' \in Y$ so that $a<z''<q$. Then we can pick $(z'',b)_Y$ (since $b$ is in $Y$) as our element that contains $q$ and is contained in $(a,b)_X \cap Y$.
\end{enumerate}
\item Suppose $h\in Y$ so that $b<h$ and $k \in Y$ so that $k<a$, we have $(a,b)_X$ completely inside $Y$, which gives us $(a,b)_Y$ as our choice of basis element.
\end{enumerate}
If our basis element is of the kind $[a_0,b)_X \cap Y$ and $q$ is in this set, then we have the following cases:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If $Y$ has a least element and there exists $z_0\in Y$ so that $q<z_0<b$, then we can choose $[y_0,z_0)_Y$ as that which contains $q$ and is contained in $[a_0,b)_X \cap Y$.
    \item If $Y$ has a least element and there exists no $z$ in $Y$ so that $q<z<b$, then either its possible that some $z'$ exists in $Y$ so that $b<z'$, but then $(q,b)$ would then fully contained in $Y$ so that we can use $[y_0,b)_Y$ as our basis element. If no such $z'$ exists, then $q$ becomes the largest element in $Y$ because $b$ is larger than any element of $Y$. That means we can choose $(y_0,q]_Y$ as our basis element that contains $q$ and is contained in $[a_0,b)_X \cap Y$.
    \item If $Y$ has no least element, then there exists $p \in Y$ so that $a_0<p<q$. \begin{enumerate}
        \item If suppose there exists no $z \in Y$ so that $q<z<b$, then either its possible that some $z'' \in Y$ so that $b<z''$ which, from convexity condition, makes $b$ fall into $Y$, and we can choose our interval to be $(p,b)_Y$ accordingly. So assuming there exists no $z'' \in Y$ so that $b<z''$, we see that $b$ is larger than all elements of $Y$ and no element of $Y$ is larger than $q$. Therefore, $q$ becomes the maximal element of $Y$, and thus, the set $(p,q]_Y$ can be choosen.
        \item If there exists $z \in Y$ so that $q<z<b$, then the interval $(p,z)_Y$ falls into $[a_0,b)_X \cap Y$ and also contains $X$. 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
If we take a basis element of the kind $(a,b_0]_X \cap Y$ and $q$ is in this set, then we have the following cases:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If $Y$ has a largest element $y_0$ and there exists $z_0$ in $Y$ so that $a<z_0<q$, then we can simply take $(z_0,y_0]_Y$ that contains $q$, and also is contained in $(a,b_0]_X \cap Y$. 
    \item If $Y$ has a largest element $y_0$ but there is no $z_0$ in $Y$ so that $a<z_0<q$, then either there is a $t \in Y$ so that $t<a$ which makes $a$ fall inside $Y$, thus allowing us to make use of $(a,y_0]_Y$. So we suppose $a$ is smaller than all elements in $Y$. This means that $q$ is indeed the smallest element of $Y$, so we can make use of $[q,y_0)_Y$ that contains $q$ and falls inside $(a,b_0]_X \cap Y$.
    \item If $Y$ has no largest element, then there exists $r\in Y$ so that $q<r<b_0$. \begin{enumerate}
        \item If suppose there exists no $z'' \in Y$ so that $a<z''<q$, then either its possible that some $t$ is there in $Y$ that is smaller than $a$, thus making $a$ a point of $Y$ so that we can make use of $(a,r)_Y$ that contains $q$. So we suppose there is no such $t$, i.e, $a$ is smaller than all elements of $Y$. This implies $q$ is the minimal element of $Y$, so that we can make use of $[q,r)_Y$ that contains $q$ and is itself contained in $(a,b_0]_X \cap Y$.
        \item If there exists $z'' \in Y$ so that $a<z''<q$, then we can choose $(z'',r)_Y$ as that interval that contains $q$ such that it is itelf contained in $(a,b_0]_X \cap Y$.
    \end{enumerate} 
In all cases, for every basis element of $\TTT^S_Y$ and for every $x$ in said basis element, there exists a basis element of $\TTT^0_Y$ that contains $x$ and is iteslf contained in $\TTT^0_Y$. Thus $\TTT^S_Y \subseteq \TTT^0_Y$ which gives $\TTT^S_Y=\TTT^0_Y$.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{proof} (\emph{\textbf{Alt}}) We know that the order topology is generated by the subbasis of all rays $(a,+\infty)$ and $(-\infty,a)$ for every $a \in X$. Suppose $Y \subseteq X$ is a convex set. Note that, the subspace topology of $Y$, $\TTT^S_Y$ is generated by the subbasis $\{(a,+\infty) \cap Y, (-\infty,a) \cap Y: a \in X\}$. Let $\TTT^0_Y$ denote the order topology of $Y$, generated by the subbasis $\{(x,+\infty)_Y, (-\infty,x): x \in Y\}$ where $(x,+\infty)_Y:=\{z \in Y: x<z\}$. 
    \\\\ \textbf{First we prove that $\TTT^0_Y \subseteq \TTT^S_Y$ (which does not require convexity)}
    \\\\ Let $U=(x,\infty)_Y=\{z \in Y: x<z\}=(x,\infty)_X \cap Y$ for $x \in Y$. This is easily seen to be a subbasis element of $\TTT^S_Y$. Likewise, it is easy to see that $(-\infty,x)_Y$ for $x \in Y$ is also a subbasis element of $\TTT^S_Y$. So any arbitrary union of finite intersection of subbases of $\TTT^0_Y$ ends up being an arbitrary union of a finite intersection of subbasis elements of $\TTT^S_Y$, which makes any set open in $\TTT^0_Y$ open in $\TTT^S_Y$. Hence $\TTT^0_Y \subseteq \TTT^S_Y$.
    \\\\ \textbf{Now we prove that $\TTT^S_Y \subseteq \TTT^0_Y$ (here convexity is needed) }
    \\\\ Let $U=(x,\infty)_X\cap Y$ for $x \in X$. If $x \in Y$, then this becomes a subbasis element. Suppose $x$ is not in $Y$. If $x$ is neither an upper bound, nor a lowerbound of $Y$, then it ends up falling into $Y$ from convexity. Therefore, it either is a lowerbound, in which case $U$ becomes $Y$ itself, or its an upper bound, in which case $U$ becomes empty. Similarly, suppose $U=(-\infty,x)_X \cap Y$ for $x \in X$. If $x \in Y$, this is precisely a subbasis element. If not, its either a lower / upper bound, making this again, a subbasis element of $\TTT^0_Y$. Hence $\TTT^S_Y \subseteq \TTT^0_Y$ which gives $\TTT^S_Y =\TTT^0_Y$.
    
    
    \end{proof}
} 

Note that, in proving that $\TTT^0_Y \subseteq \TTT^S_Y$, we do not make use of the convexity of $Y$. This motivates the following theorem:
\thmp{Let $X$ be an ordered set with the order topology $\TTT^0_X$. Let $Y$ be a subset of $X$. The subspace topology $\TTT^S_Y$ on $Y$ is always finer than (or equal to) the order topology $\TTT^0_Y$ on $Y $ inherited from the order on $X$}{The first part of the previous theorem}
\lemp{If there are two topologies on $X$ such that $\TTT \subset \TTT'$ (strict inclusion), then we have that, for any subspace $A$, the subspace topologies obey $\TTT^S_A\subseteq \TTT'^S_A$, where equality can be achieved.}{We have that $\TTT\subseteq \TTT'$. $\TTT^S_A:=\{U \cap A: U \in \TTT\}$ and $\TTT'^S_A:=\{U' \cap A: U' \in \TTT'\}$. From here we see that every set open in $\TTT^S_A$ is also open in $\TTT'^S_A$ which gives $\TTT^S_A \subseteq \TTT'^S_A$. But even if $\TTT \subsetneq \TTT'$, its possible that $\TTT^S_A=\TTT'^S_A$. Consider the discrete topology $\TTT_D=\{\varnothing, \{0\}, \{1\}, \{0,1\}\}$ on $\{0,1\}$ and consider the Sirpienski topology $\TTT_S=\{\varnothing, \{0\}, \{0,1\}\}$ on $\{0,1\}$. Let $A=\{0\}$. Then the subspace  topology of $A$ from the Discrete topology is the same as the subspace topology on $A$ from the Sirpienski topology.}

\item For all $y \in X$ and $U' \in \B'$, if $y \in U'$, then there exists $U \in \B$ so that $y \in U \subseteq U'$
\end{enumerate}}{$\implies$) If $\TTT(\B)=\TTT(B')$, that means that, if we take a basis element of $\TTT(B')$, say $U'$, it is an arbitrary union of elements of $B$, and likewise any $U \in \B$ is an arbitrary union of elements of $\B'$, hence its easy to see both the properties holding.
\\\\ $\impliedby$) Suppose it is such that for every $x \in U \in \B$ we have $U'_x$ so that $x \in U'_x \subseteq U$, then $U=\cup_x U'_x$ making $U$ an arbitrary union of elements of $\B'$ giving us $\TTT(\B)\subseteq \TTT(B')$
\\\\ Likewise, it is easy to see that if the 2nd condition holds, every element of $\B'$ would be a union of elements of $\B$, making $\TTT(\B') \subseteq \TTT(\B)$. Thus $\TTT(\B)=\TTT(\B')$ implying that $\B \equiv \B'$.}

This gives us that, for any open set $A$ in $\TTT$ and for every point $x \in A$, there exists $E_x \in \TTT'$ so that $x \in E_x \subseteq A$, which makes $A$ an arbitrary union of elements from $\TTT'$.

Consider a basis element of $\TTT^0_{\RR \times \RR}$ of the form $(x\cdot y, p \cdot q)$, where, suppose $x<y$ ($x=y$ scenario is trivial). Let $a\cdot b \in (x \cdot y,p \cdot q)$.

\section{Closed Sets and Limit points}
\defn{Closed Set}{A set $A \subset X$ of a topological space is \emph{closed} if $X \setminus A$ is open}
\lemp{For a topological space, the following hold: \begin{enumerate}
\item $\varnothing$ and $X$ are both closed
\item Arbitrary intersection of closed sets are closed
\item Finite union of closed sets are closed

\\\\ Let $\{C_{\alpha}\}$ be a colleciton of closed sets, such that $X \setminus (C_{\alpha})$ are open. $\cup_{\alpha}X \setminus(C_{\alpha})$ which is $(\cap_{\alpha} C_{\alpha})^C$ is open, which gives $\cap_{\alpha} C_{\alpha}$ to be closed.
\\\\ Let $C_1,C_2 \cdots C_k$ be closed. $(\cup_{i} C_i)^c=\cap_{i} C_i^C$ which is open. Hence $\cup_i C_i$ is closed.}

\thmp{Let $Y \subseteq X$ where $X$ is some topological space, and $Y$ has the subspace topology. Then, $A\subseteq Y $ is closed in $Y$ if and only if $A$ is the intersection of a closed set of $X$ with $Y$. }{$\implies$) Let $A$ be closed in $Y$. That means $S=Y \setminus A$ is open in $Y$. $S=Y \cap G$ for some open set $G$ open in $X$. $Y\setminus S=Y \cap (S^c)=Y \cap (Y \cap G)^c$ which gives $S=Y \cap (Y^c \cup G^c)=Y \cap G^c$. This gives $A= Y \cap G^c$, whence we are done.
\\\\ $\impliedby$) Suppose $A= Y \cap F$ for some closed set $F$, closed in $X$. $F=G^c$ for some open set $G$ in $X$. $Y \setminus A=Y \cap A^c=Y \cap(Y \cap G^c)^c=Y \cap (Y^c \cup G)$ which gives $Y \setminus A=Y \cap G$, which makes $Y \setminus A$ open in $Y$, making $A$ closed in $Y$. }
\subsection{Closures and interiors}
\defn{Closure of a set $A$}{The closure of a set $A$ in a topological space $X$ is defined as the intersection of all closed sets that contain $A$. This is denoted $\overline{A}$ or $cls_X(A)$ (subscript telling with respect to which space the closure is taken) and is obviously closed.}

\\\\ $\impliedby$) If $A= A^{\circ}$, then $A$ is obviously open.}

Some random stuff on relative closures and interiors:
\thmp{Let $Y\subseteq X$ and $A \subseteq Y \subseteq X$. Then we have the following formulas: \begin{enumerate}
\item $cls_Y(A)=Y \cap cls_X(A)$
\item $int_Y(A)=int_X(A \cup Y^c) \cap Y$
\end{enumerate}}{1) $cls_Y(A)=F \cap Y$ for some closed set $F$ closed in $X$, this much is obvious. It is also clear that $F$ must contain $A$, which implies $cls_X(A) \subseteq F$, implying that $cls_X(A)\cap Y \subseteq cls_Y(A)$. Also note that, $cls_Y(A) \subseteq cls_X(A) \cap Y$ since $cls_Y(A)$ is supposed to be the smallest closed set in $Y$ that contains $A$, and $cls_X(A) \cap Y$ is a closed set that contains $A$. Therefore, $cls_X(A)\cap Y=cls_Y(A)$.
\\\\ 2) $int_Y(A)= \cup_{G \text{ open in }X, G\cap Y \subseteq A}(G \cap Y)=\cup_{G \text{ open in }X, G \subseteq A \cup Y^c } (G \cap Y)$ which gives $int_X(A \cup Y^c) \cap Y=int_Y(A)$. }
\textbf{The situation for metric spaces:} We define closure for metric spaces as $$\overline{A}:=\{x \in X: \forall \varepsilon>0, B_{\varepsilon}(x) \cap A \neq \varnothing\}$$ This is equivalent to the usual limit point definition, which is, in turn, equivalent to the smallest closed set definition (in a metric space). Taking motivation from that, we give the following alternate definition for closure:
\defn{Closure of a set $A$}{$$\overline{A}:=\{x \in X: \forall U \in \TTT_X \text{ such that }x \in U, U \cap A \neq \varnothing \}$$ basically states that the closure is the collection of points of $X$ such that, for every neighbourhood $U$ of said point, $U$ intersects $A$. }
\thmp{The two definitions are equivalent, i.e, the set $$B:=\{x \in X: \forall nbd(x), nbd(x) \cap A\neq \varnothing\}$$ and the set $$C:=\cap_{F \text{ closed in }X: A \subseteq F } F$$ are the same.}{ First, suppose $x \not \in \overline{A}$ which means $x \in (\overline{A})^C$ which is an open set that does not contain $A$, i.e, has no intersection with $A$. So for this $x$, there exists a neighbourhood (open) $(\overline{A})^c$ that does not intersect with $A$, i.e, $x \not\in B$.
\\\\ Now suppose $x \not \in B$, i.e, there exists a neighbourhood $nbd(x)$ that has no intersection with $A$, i.e, $nbd(x)\subseteq A^c$. So $A \subseteq nbd(x)^C$, which means $\overline{A}\subseteq nbd(x)^C$, or $nbd(x) \subseteq (\overline{A})^c$ which implies $x$ is not inside $\overline{A}$.}

\lemp{If suppose topology on $X$ is given by a basis $\B$. Then $x\in \overline{A}$ if and only if for every basis element $B$ containing $x$, $B \cap A\neq \varnothing$}{If $x \in \overline{A}$, we know that for every neighbourhood of $x$, it intersects with $A$. Since every basis element of $x$ is a neighbourhood, it is true for this also, i.e, every basis element containing $x$ intersects with $A$. Suppose, on the converse, that every basis element containing $x$ intersects with $A$. Let $nbd(x)$ be a neighbourhood of $x$. By definition, there exists $B \in \B$ such that $x\in B \subseteq nbd(x)$, which means tht $nbd(x) \cap A \neq \varnothing$. We are done.}
\subsection{Limit Points}
\defn{Limit Point}{Let $A$ be a subset of a topological space $X$. If $x \in X$, we say $x$ is a \emph{limit point} of $A$ if $\forall nbd(x)$, $nbd(x)\setminus{(x)}\cap A\neq \varnothing$. Said differently, $x$ is a limit point of $A$ if in every neighbourhood $nbd(x)$, there exists a point of $A$ that is not $x$.}
\thmp{Let $F'$ be the set of all limit points of $F$. Then $\overline{F}=F \cup F'$}{Consider $F \cup F'$, i.e, the set of all points of $F$, as well as the set of all limit points of $F$. Note that, if $x \in F$, then $F \in \overline{F}$ since every neighbourhood of $x$ obviously intersects $F$. Let $x$ be a limit point, i.e, every neighbourhood of $x$ intersects of $A$. Yet again, we see, by definition, $x \in \overline{F}$. Hence, $F \cup F'\subseteq \overline{F}$. Let $x \in \overline{F}$. If $x$ is not in $F$, that means that every neighbourhood $nbd(x)$ intersects $F$, but more can be said, i.e, $nbd(x)\setminus\{x\}$ intersects $F$, making $x$ a limit point of $F$. Therefore, either an element of $\overline{F}$ is a point of $F$ or a limit point of $F$, implying that $\overline{F}=F \cup F'$ }
\thmp{(\textbf{Cool Theorem}) $$(A^{\circ})^C=\overline{(A^C)}\text{ and }(A^c)^{\circ}=\overline{A}^{c}$$}{$A^{\circ} \subseteq A$ which gives $A^c \subseteq (A^{\circ})^C$ which means $\overline{A^c} \subseteq (A^{\circ})^C$.

\\\\ This implies $$(A^{\circ})^C=\overline{(A^c)} $$
For part (2), we can simply replace in (1), $A$ with $A^c$, i.e, $((A^c)^{\circ})^c=\overline{(A)}$, which means $$(A^c)^{\circ}=\overline{A}^{c}$$}

\subsection{Hausdorff Spaces}
\defn{Hausdorff Space}{A topological space $X$ is said to be \emph{Hausdorff} if for each pair of distinct points $x_1,x_2$, there exists neighbourhoods $U_1$ and $U_2$ of $x_1$ and $x_2$ respectively such that $U_1 \cap U_2= \varnothing$.}
\thmp{Every finite set in a Hausdorff space is closed}{A set is closed if and only if it contains all of its limit points. Let $S=\{x_1,x_2 \cdots x_p\}$ be our given set. Say $x$ is a limit point of $S$, which is not in $S$. That means that there exists pairs $(nbd(x_1), nbd_1(x))$, $(nbd(x_2),nbd_2(x)) , \cdots$ and $(nbd(x_p),nbd_p(x))$ such that $nbd(x_i)\cap nbd_i(x)=\varnothing$ (Hausdorff property). This implies that $Q=\cap_{i=1}^p nbd_i(x)$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ that intersects with none of $nbd(x_i)$, which means $Q$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ that does not intersect with $S$. This contradicts the assumption that $x$ is a limit point of $S$ that is not in $S$. This implies $x$ is either in $S$ or is not a limit point of $S$. Hence, $S$ contains all of its limit points.}
\begin{example}
    Let $X=\{a,b,c\}$ and $\TTT_1=\{\varnothing, \{a\},\{a,b\}, \{a,b,c\} \}$. This topology is non-Hausdorff, since, given $a$ and $b$, two distinct points, we can't find $U_1$ and $U_2$ such that $a \in U_1$, $b \in U_2$ and $U_1 \cap U_2=\varnothing$
    \\\\ If we consider the topology $\TTT_2=\{\varnothing, \{a,b\},\{a,b,c\}\}$ (again, a non-Hausdorff topology), we note that $b$ is a limit point of the point set $\{a\}$, but $b$ does not belong in $\{a\}$ (obviously). We can, hence, have non-Hausdorff topologies so that finite point sets need not contain their limit points. Moreover, if we consider the indiscrete topology, every element is a limit point of every set.
    \\\\ Let $X$ be the topology $\{\varnothing, \{a,b\}, \{b\}, \{b,c\}, \{a,b,c\}\}$. Consider the set $S=\{b,c\}$. $a$ is a limit point of $S$ since every neighbourhood of $a$ contains an element of $\{b,c\}$ that is not $a$. 
    \\\\ For metric spaces, finite point sets have no limit points in $X$ at all. But this is a very strong condition, and we have seen the existence of finite point sets that do have a limit point. 
    \\\\ But if our space is Hausdorff (actually, weaker, a $T_1$ space), finite point sets must necesarily have no limit points, as the next theorem (and the definition) outlines:
\end{example}

\defn{$T_1$ axiom}{A space $X$ in which finite point sets are closed is called a \emph{$T_1$ space}.}

\thmp{The above two definitions are equivalent.}{$\implies$) Let $X$ be such that every finite point set is closed. }
\begin{example}
    (\textbf{We can have $T_1$ spaces that are non-Hausdorff}). Consider $\RR$ and the topology finite complement topology, i.e, a set is open if and only if its complement is empty, $\RR$ or finite.

Since only finite points are not in $U_1$ and $U_2$, they will necessarily be non disjoint. Hence, this space can never be Hausdorff. (In fact this space is called a \emph{Hyperconnected space})
\end{example}
\thmp{Let $X$ be a $T_1$ space and $A$ a subset of $X$.

Suppose also that $(nbd(x)) \cap A$ is finite for some neighbourhood of $x$, enumerate it as $\{x_1,x_2,\cdots x_k\}$. Since every finite point set is closed, $nbd(x) \setminus \{x_1,x_2 \cdots x_k\}=nbd(x) \cap \{x_1,x_2,\cdots x_k\}^c$ is open, and contains $x$. But note that this neighbourhood does not intersect $A$ at all, because we removed all the points that belonged in the intersection of $nbd(x)$ and $A$. This contradicts the assumption that $x$ is a limit point.

\thmp{In a Hausdorff space, sequences converge to a unique point}{Let $x$ and $y$ be a limit of $x_n$. Consider $U$ and $V$ such that $x \in U$ $y \in V$ and $U \cap V= \varnothing$. There exists $n_{U}$ such that $\forall n \geq n_U$, $x_n \in U$, which means that only finite points of $x_n \in V$, which is a contradiction. }
\lemp{\begin{enumerate}
\item Order topology is always Hausdorff
\item Product topology of two Hausdorff spaces is Hausdorff
\item Subspace topology of a Hausdorff space is Hausdorff
\end{enumerate}}{1) Let $x,y \in X$. WLOG assume $x<y$. Consider $x \in (-\infty,y)$ and $y \in (x, \infty)$. If they have an intersection, it would be $(-\infty,y) \cap (x,\infty):=\{z \in X: x<z<y\}=(x,y)$ which is open. If this $(x,y)$ is non empty, then pick that element $q \in (x,y)$, and consider $(-\infty,q)$ and $(q,\infty)$.
\\\\ 2) Consider $X \times Y$, where $X$ and $Y$ are Hausdorff topologies. Let $(x,y), (x',y') \in X \times Y$. There exists $A, A' \subseteq X$ such that $x \in A, x'\in A'$ and $A \cap A'=\varnothing$. Likewise for $y$ and $y'$ there exists a corresponding $B,B' \subseteq Y$. Hence, $(x,y) \in A \times B$ and $(x',y' )\in A' \times B'$ such that $A \times B \cap A' \times B'$ is empty. These are neighbourhoods, hence, $X \times Y$ is Hausdorff.
\\\\ 3) Let $Y \subseteq X$ where $X$ is Hausdorff. Consider $z,z' \in Y$. Since $z$ and $z' $ are also in $X$, $\exists U,U' \in \TTT_X$ such that $z \in U, z' \in U'$ and $U \cap U'=\varnothing$. Therefore, $z \in U \cap Y, z'\in U' \cap Y $ and $(U \cap Y) \cap (U' \cap Y)=\varnothing$. Hence subspace topology is Hausdorff. }
