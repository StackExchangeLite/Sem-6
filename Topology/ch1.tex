\defn{Topology}{A \emph{topology} $\tau$ on a set $X$ is a collection $\mathscr{B}$ of sets called \emph{open sets} such that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\varnothing$ and $X$ belong to $\mathscr{B}$
\item For any collection of sets $U_{\alpha} \in \mathscr{B}$, $\cup_{\alpha} U_{\alpha}$ is also in $\mathscr{B}$ (closed under arbitrary unions)
\item For any finite collection $\{U_1,U_2 \cdots U_k\}$ of sets of $\mathscr{B}$, $\cap_{i=1}^{k}U_i \in \mathscr{B}$ (closed under finite intersections)
\end{enumerate}}
\defn{Discrete and Indiscrete topology}{\begin{enumerate}
    \item The topology $(\varnothing,X)$ of a set $X$ is called the \emph{indiscrete topology}.
    \item The topology in which every subset of $X$ is an open set is called the \emph{Discrete topology}
\end{enumerate} }
\defn{Finer and Coarser topologies}{Let $\tau$ and $\tau'$ be two topologies of space $X$. We say $\tau'$ is \emph{finer} than $\tau$ if $\tau \subset \tau'$, or every open set in $\tau$ is one in $\tau'$. In other words, $\tau$ is \emph{coarser} than $\tau$.}
\begin{remark}
    Of course, not all topologies are comparable, like the above definition suggests. For example, consider the 3 element space $\{x,y,z\}$. $\{\varnothing,(x),(x,y),(x,y,z)\}$ is a topology as can easily be seen. Likewise, $\{\varnothing,(x),(y,z),(x,y,z)\}$ is also a topology, but these two are not comparable, since their symmetric difference is non-empty.
\end{remark}
\begin{example}
    \textbf{The finite complement topology:} Let $X$ be a set. Consider the set of all $U \in X$ such that $U^C$ is either finite or $X$. Obviously, $\varnothing$ is in this collection, as is $X$. Let $\{U_{\alpha}:\alpha \in A\}$ by an arbitrary collection of such sets. Consider $(\cup_{\alpha} U_{\alpha})^C=\cap_{\alpha} U^{C}_{\alpha}$ which is easily seen to be finite. Hence, closed under arbitrary unions.
    Consider $\{U_1,U_2 \cdots U_k\}$ of such sets. $(\cap_{i=1}^{k}U_{i})^C=\cup_{i=1}^{n} U^{C}_i$ which is, at max, finite. Hence, closed under finite intersections. Therefore, this collection is a topology and is called the \emph{Finite Complement Topology}.
\end{example}

\defn{Basis for a topology}{Let $X$ be a space. $C$ is called a \emph{basis} for $X$ if the following are satisfied:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item For every $x \in X$, there exists a $C_x$ in $C$ so that $x \in C_x$
    \item If $x$, $C_1$ and $C_2$ are such that $x \in C_1 \cap C_2 \neq \varnothing$, then there exists $C_{12} \in C$ such that $x \in C_{12} \subseteq C_{1} \cap C_{2}$ 
\end{enumerate}}

\defn{Topology \emph{generated} by a basis $\C$ of $X$}{The topology $\tau_{\C}$ generated by the basis $\C$ is defined as the collection $\U$ of subsets of $X$ such that if $U \in \U$, and $x \in U$, then there exists $C \in \C$ such that $x \in C \subseteq U$. It is obvious that $\C$ itself is contained in $\U$. }
\thmp{The topology $\tau_{\C}$ generated by $\C$, a basis, does indeed form a topology.}{Does $X$ belong to $\tau_{\C}$? let $x \in X$. By virtue of being a basis, there exists a $C_x \subseteq X$ such that $x \in C_x$. Hence, $X \in \tau_{\C}$. Does $\varnothing \in \tau_{\C}$? Vacuously so. Let $U_{\alpha}$ be open in $\tau_{\C}$. Consider $\cup_{\alpha} U_{\alpha}$ and $x \in \cup_{\alpha} U_{\alpha}$. This means $x \in U_{\delta}$ for some $\delta$. That means that there exists $C_{x}$ so that $x \in C_x \subseteq U_{\delta} \subseteq \cup_{\alpha} U_{\alpha}$. This means $\tau_{\C}$ is closed under arbitrary union.
Consider singleton collections, for the moment, of the kind $\{U_1\}$. It is obvious that the intersection of every element in this collection is part of $\tau_{\C}$. Consider a two sized collection $\{U_1,U_2\}$. Let $x \in U_1 \cap U_2$. Obviously, $x \in C_1 \subseteq U_1$ and $x \in C_2 \subseteq U_2$. From the definition of basis, there exists a basis element $C$ so that $x \in C \subseteq C_1 \cap C_2 \subseteq U_1 \cap U_2$ making $\cap_{i=1}^2 U_i$ part of the topology. Assume such is true for all $n$ sized collections. Consider an $n+1$ sized collection $\{U_1,U_2 \cdots U_{n+1}\}$ and consider $x \in (\cap_{i=1}^{n} U_{i} ) \cap U_{n+1}$. From the $n=2$ case and induction hypothesis, we are done. Hence, closed under finite intersections. $\tau_{\C}$ is indeed a topology.   }
\thmp{Let $\C$ be a basis for $X$. The topology generated by $\C$, that is, $\tau_{\C}$ is precisely the topology obtained by taking all possible, arbitrary union's of $\C$.}{Consider an arbitrary union of elements $C_{\alpha} \in \C$, $\cup_{\alpha} C_{\alpha}$. $x \in \cup C \implies \exists \alpha$ such that $x \in C_{\alpha}$. Therefore, $\cup_{\alpha}C_{\alpha}$ is in $\tau_{\C}$. Now, let $U \in \tau_{\C}$. For every $x \in U$, there exists $C_x$ in $\C$ such that $x \in C_x \subseteq U $ (Definition of the generated topology). That means, $U=\cup_{x: x \in U} C_x$ which makes it the union of sets in the collection $\C$. We are done.}
\begin{example}
    If $X$ is a metric space, the collection $\{B_{\varepsilon}(x): x \in X, \varepsilon \in \RR^+\}$ is a basis for $X$. 
\end{example}

\begin{remark}
Note that, every topology $\tau$ is its own basis. It must also be noted that the same topology can be generated by two different bases. Consider for example the set of all open subsets of $\RR$. Also consider the set of all open balls in $\RR$. Or, consider the set of all $\frac{1}{n}$ balls around all rational points of $\RR$
\end{remark}
\thmp{(Going from a topology to a basis) Suppose $(X, \tau)$ is a topological space, and $\C$ is a collection of sets in $X$ such that for every $x \in X$ and for every $U \in \tau$, $\exists C_x \in \C$ such that $x \in C_x \subseteq U$. Then $\tau$ is actually generated by $\C$}{Let $x \in X$. That means, $\exists C_x \in \C$ (from hypothesis) such that $x \in C_x \subseteq X$. Moreover, let $x \in C_1$ and $C_2$. By hypothesis, all $C \in \C$ are conidered open sets, therefore, $C_1 \cap C_2$ is an open set, and $x \in C_1 \cap C_2$. That means $\exists C_3 \in \C$ such that $x \in C_3 \subseteq C_1 \cap C_2$. That makes $\C$ a basis. Its now obvious that $\tau=\tau_{\C}$ }
\thmp{(Criteria for derermining coarseness from basis) Let $\tau$ and $\tau'$ be two topologies of $X$. Also suppose $\tau$ is generated by $\C$ and $\tau'$, by $\C'$. Then the following are equivalent: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\tau'$ is finer than $\tau$
    \item for each $x \in X$ and each basis element $C \in \C$ containing $x$, there exists $C' \in \C'$ such that $x \in C' \subseteq C$

\end{enumerate} }{$\implies)$ Suppose $\tau'$ is finer than $\tau$, that means every open set open in $\tau$ is also open in $\tau'$. Let $C \in \C$, which is open in $\tau$ (and hence, in $\tau'$ too) and let $x \in C$. Since $C$ is open in $\tau'$, and $x \in C$, there exists a basis element of $\tau'$, called $C'$ such that $x \in C' \subset C$. 
\\\\ $\impliedby)$ Let it be that for every $x \in X$ and for every $C \in \C$ such that $x \in C$, there exists $C' \in \C'$ such that $x \in C' \subseteq C$. By the definition of topology generated by bases, it is clear that $\C$ is part of the topology of $\tau'$. Consider $U \in \tau$. 
\\\\ $U$ is an arbitrary union of elements of $\C$ (by the alternate characterisation of generated topology), making $U$ an element of $\tau'$. We are done.
\\\\ (aliter) Let $U$ be such that for every $x \in U$, $\exists C \in C$ such that $x \in C \subseteq U$. Since we are told that there exists $C' \subseteq C$ so that $x \in C'$, we have that for all $x \in U$, $\exists C'_x \in \C' $ so that $x \in C_x' \subseteq U$, making $U$ part of the topology of $\tau'$. }
\defn{Standard topology of $\RR$}{Let $\B$ be the collection of all open intervals of the kind $(a,b):a,b \in \RR$. That this is a basis is obvious. Define the standard topology as that topology generated by this basis.}
\defn{lower limit topology $\RR_l$}{Conider $\B'$ the collection of all sets of the kind $[a,b): a,b \in \RR$. Again, that this is a basis is obvious. Define the lower limit topology as the topology generated by $B'$, and denote it as $\RR_l$}
\defn{K topology $\RR_K$}{Let $K$ be the set of all numbers of the kind $1/n$ for $n \in \ZZ_+$. Denote $\B''$ as the collection of all open intervals of the kind $(a,b)$ along with the sets of the form $(a,b)-K$. Again, that this is a basis is obvious. The topology generated by $\BB''$ is called the $K$ topology, denoted by $\RR_K$}
\thmp{$\RR_K$ and $\RR_l$ are strictly finer than $\RR$, but $\RR_K$ and $\RR_l$ are not comparable.}{Consider $B \in \B$, of the form $(a,b)$. This is also in $\B'$, and a smaller set of the kind $[c,d)$ lies inside $(a,b)$, which means that, if $x \in (a,b)$, there exists $B' \in \B'$ and $B'' \in \B''$ so that $x \in B' \subset (a,b)$ and $x \in \B'' \subset (a,b)$. Moreover, since both $\RR_l$ and $\RR_K$ have elements that are not in $\RR$, it is obviously strictly finer. (Consider $a \in [a,b)$, there is no element of the kind $(x,y)$ that is inside this, that contains $a$. )
\\\\ Consider an element $B=[0,1)$ where we choose $x=0$. Clear that no element from $\RR_K$ can come inside $B$ whilst containing $0$. On the other hand, consider $0$ inside $(-1,1)-K$ in $\RR_K$. No interval of the kind $[a,b)$ can contain $0$ and itself be contained inside $(-1,1)-K$. Hence, it is clear that $\RR_K$ and $\RR_l$ are incomparable.  }
\defn{Subbasis}{A subbasis $S$ is a collection of subsets of $X$ whose union amounts to $X$}
\defn{Topology generated by a subbasis}{$\tau_S$, the topology generated by the subbasis $S$ is defined as the set of all arbitrary unions of the set of all finite intersection of elements of $S$. }
\thmp{$\tau_S$, the topology generated by a subbasis $S$, is indeed a topology.}{Let $S$ be the set whose union forms $X$ (Subbasis). 

Let $Y=\{\gamma: \gamma=\cap_{i=1}^n S_i \text{ for some }n \text{ and }S_i \in S\}$, i.e, $Y$ is the set of all finite intersections of elements of $S$. Consider the set of all arbitrary union of elements of Y, and call it $\tau_S$. Obviously $\tau_S$ cotains $\varnothing$ and $X$. Let $\{U_{\alpha}\}$ be a collection of open sets in $\tau_S$, i.e, each $U_{\alpha}$ is an arbitrary union of elements that are finite intersection of elements of $S$. The union of all $U_{\alpha}$, therefore, would still be an arbitrary union of finite intersections of elements of $S$, hence, is back in $\tau_S$. Now consider $\{U_1,U_2 \cdots U_k\}$, elements of $\tau_S$ such that each $U_i$ is an arbitrary union of a collection of sets that are each a finite intersection of elements of $S$. Consider the finite intersection $\cap_{i=1}^{n} U_i=\cap_{i=1}^n (\cup_{\alpha} (\cap_{j=1}^{n_{\alpha}}S_{j,\alpha}) )$ which is ultimately an arbitrary union of a finite intersection of sets in $S$, making this part of $\tau_S$. Hence, $\tau_S$ is indeed a topology.} 
\thmp{Let $\{\tau_{\alpha}: \alpha \in A\}$ be a collection of topologies of $X$, then there is a unique "smallest" topology $\tau_S$ such that $\tau_S$ contains all the topologies $\{\tau_{\alpha}\}$ (kinda like a LUB), and there is a unique "largest: topology $\tau_L$ that is contained in all these topologies $\{\tau_{\alpha}\}$.}{\underline{\textbf{$\tau_S$ that contains all topologies $\{\tau_{\alpha}\}$}}:
\\\\ \emph{Uniqueness:} If two such topologies exists, we can take the intersection of them to result in a smaller topology (intersection is still a topology) that contains $\{\tau_{\alpha}\}$.
\\\\ \emph{Existence:} Consider the topology generated by arbitrarily unioning the sets generated by finitely intersecting all elements of $\{\tau_{\alpha}: \alpha \in A\}$. Explicitly, we collect $\R=\{U: \exists x \text{ such that }U \in \tau_{x}\}$ and we take all possible finite intersections of elements in $\R$ and collect that in a set $\S$. Then, we take all possible arbitrary unions of elements of $\S$ and call it $\tau_S$. 

For later use: 

$\bullet$ $\R=$ all the open sets in all the topologies. 

$\bullet$ $\S=$ finite intersection of all elements of $\R$

$\bullet$ $\tau_S=$ arbitrary union of all elements of $\S$

Is $\tau_S$ a topology? $X$ and $\varnothing$ are obviously there, since $X$ and $\varnothing$ are there in $\R$, and we take the singleton intersection of these in $\S$, and finally, we take the singleton union of these to arrive at $X, \varnothing \in \tau_S$. Let $\{G_{\delta}:\delta \in \Delta\}$ be a collection of sets in $\tau_S$ (i.e, a collection of sets that are an arbitrary union of a collection of finite intersection of elements of $\R$). $\cup_{\delta}G_{\delta}$ would also be an arbitrary union of elements of $\S$ making it part of $\tau_S$. Let $\{G_1,G_2,\cdots G_k\}$ be in $\tau_S$. $\cap_{i=1}^k G_i=\cap_{i=1}^k (\cup_{\delta_i} (\cap_{j=1}^{n_{\delta_i}} R_{\delta_i,j} ) )$ which, from De Morgan's Laws, can easily be seen to be an arbitrary union of a finite intersection of elements from $\R$. Hence, the intersection is also in $\tau_S$ making it a topology that contains all of $\{\tau_{\alpha}\}$.
\\\\ \underline{\textbf{$\tau_L$ that is contained in all topologies $\{\tau_{\alpha}\}$}}
\\\\ \emph{Existence:} Consider $\cap_{\alpha} \tau_{\alpha}$, which is a topology that is contained in all of $\tau_{\alpha}$. 
\\\\ \emph{Uniqueness:} If two topologies are such that they are contained in every $\tau_{\alpha}$, then they are indeed contained in $\cap_{\alpha} \tau_{\alpha}$ }
\thmp{Let $A$ be a basis for $\tau$, then $\tau_A$, the topology generated by $A$ (The one generated by taking arbitrary union of elements of $A$) is precisely the intersection of all topologies $\{\tau_{\alpha}:\alpha \in G\}$ that contain $A$}{$\tau_A$ is the topology generated by arbitrary union of elements of $A$. We are told $A \subseteq \tau_{\alpha}$ for all $\alpha \in G$. Let $U \in \tau_A$. $U$ is an arbitrary union of elements of $A$, which, since $\tau_{\alpha}$ is a topology, is also contained in $\tau_{\alpha}$. Every open set in $\tau_A$ is also in $\tau_{\alpha}$. Hence $\tau_A \subseteq \cap_{\alpha} \tau_{\alpha}$. 
\\\\ Note that, $\tau_A$ is iself a topology containing $A$, which means $\tau_A=\cap_{\alpha} \tau_{\alpha}$ }
\thmp{Let $A$ be a subbasis for $X$. The topology $\tau_A$ generated by $A$, i,e, by taking arbitrary union of elements that are finite intersection of $A$, is precisely the intersection of all topologies $\{\tau_{\alpha}\}$ that contain $A$.}{Obviousy $\tau_{A}$ contains $A$, since each element of $A$ is a singleton union of the signleton intersection of itself. Moreover, let $U$ be any open set in $\tau_A$, i.e, $U$ is an arbitrary union of a collection of finite intersections of elements of $A$. Let $\tau_{\alpha}$ be a topology that contains $A$. That means a finite intersection of elements of $A$ is still in $\tau_{\alpha}$, and an arbitrary union of these are still in $\tau_{\alpha}$. Hence, $U$ is in $\tau_{\alpha}$, for any $\alpha$. Hence, $\tau_A \subseteq \tau_{\alpha}$ for every $\alpha$, implying $\tau_A \subseteq \cap_{\alpha} \tau_{\alpha}$. Since $\tau_A$ is part of $\{\tau_{\alpha}\}$, we see $$\tau_A =\cap_{\alpha}\tau_{\alpha} $$ where $\{\tau_{\alpha}\}$ is the collection of all topologies that contain $A$.}
\subsection{Order Topology}
\defn{Simple Order}{Let $X$ be a set. Define $C:X \times X \to \{y,n\}$ such that: \begin{enumerate}
    \item If $x \neq y$, either $xCy$ or $yCx$
    \item For no $x$ is it true that $xCx$
    \item if $xCy$ and $yCz$, then $xCz$
\end{enumerate} This type of relation is called \emph{simple order} relation.
\\\\ \textbf{Pro Tip:} For intuition purposes, replace $C$ with $<$. }

\defn{Order Topology on a space $X$.}{Let $X$ be a space with more than two points, equipped with a simple order relation $<$. Consider the collection $\B$ of sets of the following kind:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $(a,b)$ where $a<b$. i.e, all open intervals in $X$
    \item $[a_0,b)$ for all $b \in X$, where $a_0$ is the smallest element of $X$
    \item $(a,b_0]$ for all $a \in X$ where $b_0$ is the largest element in $X$
\end{enumerate} Then the order topology $\tau_O$ is defined as that topology generated by $\B$.
\begin{remark}
    Note that, if $X$ has no smallest element, type (2) sets won't exist in $\B$. Likewise, if $X$ has no largest element, type (3) sets won't exist in $\B$.

\end{remark}}
\thmp{$\B$ is actually a basis (hence, $\tau_O$ is actually a well defined topology on $X$)}{Let $x \in X$. If $x$ is not the largest element, nor the smallest, then there exists $(a_0,b_0)$ that contains $x$
\\\\ If $x$ is the largest element, then $(a_0,x]$ contains $x$. If $x$ is the smallest element, then $[x,b_0)$ contains $x$. Hence, for every $x \in X$, there exists an element $B$ from $\B$ such that $x \in B$. 
\\\\ Note the following, if we intersect two type 1 sets, we get back a smaller type 1 set. i.e, $(a,b) \cap (a',b'):= \{x\in X: a<x<b \text{ and } a'<x<b' \}$.
\\ If we intersect two type 2 sets, we get back a type 2 set (obviously)
\\ If we intersect two type 3 sets, we get back a type 3 set (obviously)
\\ If we intersect a type 1 and type 2 set, i.e $(a,b)$ and $[a_0,x)$, we are basically saying $\{t \in X: a < t < b \text{ and }a_0 \leq t<x \}$ We get back a type 1 set.
\\ If we intersect a type 1 and type 3 set, i.e $(a,b)$ and $(x,b_0]$, we get $\{t \in X: a<t<b \text{ and } x<t \leq b_0 \}$ which would yield a set of type 1.
\\ If we intersect a type 2 and type 3 set, i.e, $[a_0,x)$ and $(y,b_0]$, we want basically $\{t \in X: a_0 \leq t <x \text{ and } y<t \leq b_0\}$. It is easy to see that this intersection falls into one of the 3 categories. 
\\\\ Hence, $\B$ forms a basis, and hence, $\tau_B$ is a topology.
}
\begin{example}
    The standard topology $\RR$ is basically the order topology on $\RR$. All one needs to see is that there is no least element, and largest element of $\RR$ (Of course, $\RR \cup \{-\infty,+\infty\}$, the extended real line, \emph{does} have these). Hence, $\B$ is just all elements of the kind $(a,b)$, which is precisely the basis for the standard topology.  
\end{example}
\defn{Rays}{Given $a \in X$ (a simply ordered set), there are 4 sets associated with $a$ called \emph{rays}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $(a,+\infty):=\{x: a<x\}$
    \item $(-\infty,a):=\{x: x<a\}$
    \item $[a,+\infty):=\{x:a \geq x\}$
    \item $(-\infty,a]:=\{x: x \leq x\}$

\end{enumerate}}
\thmp{The first two rays are open in the order topology, (and the 2nd two rays are closed in the order topology, i.e, its complement is open)}{Consider $(a,+\infty)$. If there is no maximum element, then this is precisely an arbitrary union of sets of the kind $(a,b_{\alpha})$. If there is a maximal element, then this is $(a,b_0]$. In a similar fashion, the 2nd set is also open.
\\\\ Consider $[a,+\infty)^C=(-\infty,a)$, and consider $(-\infty,a]^C=(a,\infty)$. Obvious from here.}
\thmp{The collection of all open \emph{rays} forms a subbasis for the order topology on $X$}{We have to show that the topology generated by arbitrarily unioning a collection of finite intersections of rays gives rise to the topology generated by the bais of order topology of $X$. Let $\tau_R$ be the topology generated by the arbitrary union of finite intersection of rays. Let $\tau$ be the order topology on $X$, generated by arbitrary union of the basis elements of $X$. We want to show $\tau_R \subseteq \tau$ and $\tau \subseteq \tau_R$.
\\\\ Consider $(a,b)$, a basis element of $\tau$. $(a,+\infty) \cap (-\infty,b)$ is a finite intersection of rays, and yields the basis $(a,b)$. $[a_0,b)$ is, simply, $(-\infty,b)$ and $(a,b_0]$ is simply $(a,+\infty)$. Hence, finite intersection of the rays yield the basis elements. Arbitrary union of finite intersection of rays can yield all the possible open sets of the order topology on $X$. Hence, $\tau \subseteq \tau_R$. Let $S$ be open in $\tau_R$. It is the arbitrary union of a finite intersection of rays. Note that every ray is either an element of the basis for $\tau$ or is an arbitrary union elements of basis of $\tau$. An arbitrary union of a finite intersection of an arbitrary union of elements of the basis yields an arbitrary union of a finite intersection of elements of the basis, giving rise to yet another element of the topology $\tau$. Hence, every open et in $\tau_R$ is open in $\tau$, hence $\tau_R \subseteq \tau$ }
\subsection{The product topology}
\defn{Product topology on $X \times Y$}{Let $\tau_X$ and $\tau_Y$ be topologies of $X$ and $Y$ respectively. Let $\B$ be the collection of subsets of $X \times Y $ of the kind $U \times V$ for $U \in \tau_X$ and $V \in \tau_Y$. We define the product topology as that which is generated by the basis $\B$. }
\thmp{$\B$ of the previous definition is indeed a basis.}{Let $(x,y) \in X \times Y $. Since $X \in \tau_X$ and $Y \in \tau_Y$, we have that $(x,y)\in X \times Y$ so the 1st condition for basis is satisfied. Let $(x,y) \in U_1 \times V_1$ and $U_2 \times V_2$. Consider $(U_1 \times V_1)\cap (U_2 \times V_2)$. This is same as $U_1 \cap U_2 \times V_1 \cap V_2$ which is again an element of $\B$. Hence, it is a basis and hence $\tau_{\B}$ is well defined.}
\thmp{If $X'$s topology $\TTT_X$ is generated by a basis $\B_X$ and $Y'$s topology $\TTT_Y$ is generated by a basis $\B_Y$, then the product topology of $X \times Y$ 

(given by$\langle \{U \times V: U \text{ open in} \TTT_X \text{ and } V \text{ open in } \TTT_Y \} \rangle$) has a basis $\B:=\{C \times D: C \in \B_X, D \in \B_Y\}$, i.e, $$\TTT_{X \times Y}=\langle \{U \times V: U \in \TTT_X, V \in \TTT_Y\} \rangle=\langle_{\text{basis}} \B:=\{C \times D: C \in \B_X, D \in \B_Y\} \rangle$$}{\emph{Checking that $\B$ is indeed a basis:}
\\\\ Let $(x,y) \in X \times Y$. $x \in X$ means that there exists $B \in \B_X$ so that $x \in B \subseteq X$. Likewise, for $y$, there is a $C \in \B_Y$ so that $y \in C \subseteq Y$, which means $(x,y) \in B \times C \subseteq X \times Y$. This means that $\B$ obeys the 1st condition for a basis.
\\\\ Let $(x,y) \in B,B' \in \B$. i.e, $(x,y) \in C_1 \times D_1, \text{ and }C_2 \times D_2 $ for $C_1,C_2 \in \B_X$ and $D_1,D_2 \in \B_Y$. That means that $(x,y) \in (C_1 \times D_1) \cap (C_2 \times D_2)=(C_1 \times C_2) \times (D_1 \times D_2)$. $x \in C_1 \cap C_2$ means there is a $C_3$ so that $x \in C_3 \subseteq C_1 \cap C_2$. Likewise, $y \in D_3 \subseteq D_1 \cap D_2 $. Hence, $(x,y) \in (C_3 \times D_3) \subseteq (C_1 \cap C_2) \times (D_1 \times D_2)=(C_1 \times D_1)\cap (C_2 \times D_2)$. Hence, $\B$ is a basis.
\\\\ Now consider any open set in $\TTT_{X \times Y}.$ Since $\TTT_{X\times Y}$ is generated by $U \times V: U \in \TTT_X, V \in \TTT_Y$, Every open set in $\TTT_{X \times Y}$ is an arbitrary union of sets of the kind $U \times V$, i.e, $\cup_{\alpha}(U_{\alpha}\times V_{\alpha})$. But each $U_{\alpha}= \cup_{\delta(\alpha)} B_{\delta}^{\alpha}$ for $B_{\delta}^{\alpha} \in \B_X$. Likewise, each $V_{\alpha}= \cup_{\delta(\alpha)} C_{\delta}^{\alpha} $ for  $C_{\delta}^{\alpha} \in \B_Y$. Let $(x,y)$ be any point in $X$, that is in $\cup_{\alpha}(U_{\alpha} \times V_{\alpha})$ which means that there exists $\alpha_0$ so that $(x,y) \in U_{\alpha_0} \times V_{\alpha_0}= \cup_{\delta(\alpha_0)} B_{\delta} \times \cup_{\delta{(\alpha_0)}} C_{\delta}$. This means $x \in B_{\delta_0}$ and $y \in C_{\delta_1}$ for some indices. This means that $(x,y) \in B_{\delta_0} \times C_{\delta_1}$, which is part of the basis $\B$. Hence, Every open set in $\TTT_{X\times Y}$ is open in $\langle \B \rangle$ (or $\TTT_{X \times Y} \subseteq \langle \B \rangle$). Moreover, it is obvious to see that every element of $\B$ is open in $\TTT_{X \times Y}$. Hence, arbitrary union of elements of $\B$, which are precisely the open sets of $\B$, are also open in $\TTT_{X \times Y}$. Hence, $\TTT_{X \times Y}=\langle \B \rangle$. 
}
\begin{example}
    Consider $X=\RR, Y=\RR$, with the standard topologies (i.e, that which is generated by the basis elements of the kind $\{(a,b); a<b\}$). The \textbf{\emph{standard topology}} on $\RR \times \RR=\RR^2$ is defined as the product topology. A basis for this topology is the set of all $U \times V$ for $U$ and $V$ open in $\RR$, but from the preceeding result we can find an even smaller subset that makes a basis: $\{B \times C: B \in \B_X, C \in \B_Y\} $ which is precisely $\{(a,b) \times (c,d): a,b,c,d \in \RR; a<b, c<d\}$

\defn{Projections}{Define $\pi_1:X \times Y \to X$ by $\pi_1(x,y)=x$ and $\pi_2:X\times Y \to Y$ given by $\pi_2(x,y)=y$. These maps are called projection maps.}
\thmp{The projection maps are onto, and have the property that, if $U$ is an open subset of $X$, and $V$ is an open subset of $Y$, then $\pi_1^{-1}(U)=U \times Y $ and $\pi_2^{-1}(V)=X \times V$ (well, open hypothesis is not needed really)}{That they are onto functions is obvious. Let $U$ be an open subset of $X$. Consider $\pi_1^{-1}(U):=\{(x,y) \in X \times Y: \pi_1(x,y)=x \in U\}$. This is precisely $U \times Y$. Similarly, $\pi_2^{-1}(V)=X \times V$. Note that, in the product topology, $U \times Y$ and $X \times V$ are both open sets. Moreover, the intersection of $\pi_1^{-1}(U)$ and $\pi_2^{-1}(V)$ is $(U \times Y) \cap (X \times V)= U \times V$ }
\thmp{Let $\TTT_X$ be a topology for $X$ and $\TTT_Y$ for $Y$. Let $\TTT_{X \times Y}:=\langle \{U \times V: U \in \TTT_X, V \in \TTT_Y\} \rangle $ be the product topology on $X \times Y$. Then the set $\Gamma:=\{\pi_1^{-1}(U):U \in \TTT_X\} \cup \{\pi_2^{-1}(V): V \in \TTT_Y\}$ forms a subbasis for $\TTT_{X\times Y}$}{$\Gamma$ is full of elements of the kind $U \times Y$ and $X\times V$ (every element is of this kind, and every element of this kind is in $\Gamma$). Consider any open set in $\TTT_{X \times Y}$, which is an arbitrary union of elements of the type $U \times V$, or explicitly, an open set looks like $\cup_{\alpha}(U_{\alpha} \times V_{\alpha})$ which is the same as $\cup_{\alpha}((U_{\alpha} \times Y)\cap (X \times V_{\alpha}))=\cup_{\alpha} \pi_{1}^{-1}(U_{\alpha}) \cap \pi_2^{-1}(V_{\alpha})$ which is an arbitrary union of an intersection of elements of $\Gamma$. Hence, we see that every set open in $\TTT_{X \times Y}$ is open in $\langle_{subbasis} \Gamma\rangle$, which means $\TTT_{X \times Y} \subseteq \langle_{subbasis }\Gamma \rangle$. Let $C$ be a set in $\langle_{subbasis} \Gamma \rangle$, i.e, $C$ is an arbitrary union of a finite intersection of sets in $\Gamma$. If the finite intersection only contains elements of the kind $U \times Y$ (or $X \times V$) }
