\section{Topological Spaces}
\defn{Topology}{A \emph{topology} $\tau$ on a set $X$ is a collection $\mathscr{B}$ of sets called \emph{open sets} such that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\varnothing$ and $X$ belong to $\mathscr{B}$
\item For any collection of sets $U_{\alpha} \in \mathscr{B}$, $\cup_{\alpha} U_{\alpha}$ is also in $\mathscr{B}$ (closed under arbitrary unions)
\item For any finite collection $\{U_1,U_2 \cdots U_k\}$ of sets of $\mathscr{B}$, $\cap_{i=1}^{k}U_i \in \mathscr{B}$ (closed under finite intersections)
\end{enumerate}}
\defn{Discrete and Indiscrete topology}{\begin{enumerate}
    \item The topology $(\varnothing,X)$ of a set $X$ is called the \emph{indiscrete topology}.
    \item The topology in which every subset of $X$ is an open set is called the \emph{Discrete topology}
\end{enumerate} }
