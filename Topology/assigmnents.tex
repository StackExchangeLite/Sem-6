\textbf{Problem 1:} Show that a subset is closed if and only if it contains all its limit points
\\\\ \textbf{Solution:} 
\\\\ \textbf{Definition:} (Limit point) $x$ is a limit point of $S$ if for every neighbourhood of $x$, $nbd(x)-\{x\}$ intersects $S$. 
\\\\ \textbf{Definition:} (Closure) The smallest closed set that contains $A$ is called the closure of $A$ denoted $cls_X(A)$.
